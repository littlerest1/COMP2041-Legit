21/09/18			16:30				23:30				Researching,Coding			Understand rm command and do simple functions

23/09/18			11:00 				16:20				Researching,Coding			rewrite the whole functions for remove and some 
																						of the test functions.			

24/09/18			11:00				17:00				Coding						The program works for subset1_13 but fail for subset1_11 and 12

26/09/18			11:30				23:30				Coding						Solve the problem and start doing subset2

Start doing assignment 1.Coded for subset 0.Since a lot of confusing about the error handling and data structure about legit.
Use plenty of time for check and test with legit in cse machine.Also,roughly finish subset0.

Tracking autotest in cse machine with my code.Based on the fail test result,fix the bugs.
At 15:03,finally finish subset0.Note:a lot of uninitialize problem is happens when the condition is not clear.It might be opening
or assign in a null or empty file.

Start coding for subset1.First of all,understand the meaning of the command and what willing me to do for this command.
For comment [-a] -m message : update all the files in index folder(commited) compare to the same file in current directory.
For rm [--force][--cached] filenames : 
command: rm --force --cached a:
	a is in repository:
	if a is in repository,deleted a in both (index and repository folder) without checking the status of a
command: rm --cached --force a:
	same as above
command: rm --cached --force c:
	c is in index but not in repository
	c going to untracked status
The meaning of rm command:if the user upload his/her works into repository,the works can be removed from index folder and current
directory if there are no changes in current directory.However if user use force option it will delete from index folder without checking.
The --cached option,only removed the files in index folder but not current directory.

For status command: This command is for all the files in the current directory
status deleted: delete via legit(may found in repository?)
	file deleted:delete from file system

Could not pass the subset1_13 autotest for remove command,it's about add a file after removal,very confusing for that test.

23/09/18
Understand what does it means for add and commit after removal. Depend on that,I found out my previous implementation
about commit and add is not good for further implementation.I need to rewrite the whole functions for that and some 
of the test functions.

The program works for subset1_13 but fail for subset1_11 and 12.Still finding a solution for that problem.

Going to Blue Mountain with High school friends.One day off ^-^.

Solve the problem,and going to status part for subet 1.Finished subset1 in 20:56.Starting subset2 in 22:00.Finished branch command and starting for 
checkout command before I am going
to sleep.

Fixing the checkout command bugs.However in subset2_23 autotest,It runs correct output in my computer terminal.However it has different output in cse machine.
I can sure they are the same code.Also, I find out if I write $a = chomp $b it returns 1 which means is success. If I want to get $b without newline. I should 
only write chomp $b.
